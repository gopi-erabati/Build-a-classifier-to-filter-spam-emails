# Build-a-classifier-to-filter-spam-emails

The aim of this project is to build a classifier to filter spam emails. Before training a classifier, we can apply several preprocessing methods to this data such as standardize, transform or binarize data. For each preprocessing data a logistic regression model is fit and compared with Naive Bayes classifier.
