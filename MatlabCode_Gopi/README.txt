To run the logistic regression and SVM

1. Chnage your current working directory of MATLAB to this code folder.
2. Run the 'main.m' file which gives result of problem 1 and problem 2 on command window.

	You can get help for any function written, by just running the command:
	help <functionName>

	eg. help getPreProcess

Cheers!
